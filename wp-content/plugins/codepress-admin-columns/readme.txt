Customise columns on the administration screens for post(types), pages, media, comments, links and users with an easy to use drag-and-drop interface.

== Description ==

Completely customise the columns on the administration screens with a nice drag and drop interface.

By default, WordPress only shows a few built-in columns. This plugin will give you many additional columns. You will have full control over all columns for pages, posts, posttypes, media, links, comments and users.

Add or remove columns, change their label, change their width and reorder them.

<a href="http://www.admincolumns.com">Admin Columns Pro</a> offers additional features such as direct inline editing (edit post data directly from your columns), sorting, filtering and Advanced Custom Fields integration.

= Post Types Columns  =

The following custom columns are added:

* Featured Image
* Excerpt
* Post Attachments
* Page Order
* Page Templates
* Post Formats
* Taxonomies
* ID

= Sortable & Filterable Columns for all Screens =

All of the new columns will have support for sorting and filtering with <a href="http://www.admincolumns.com">Admin Columns Pro</a>.

By default WordPress let's you only sort by Title, Date, Comments and Author. This will make you be able to <strong>sort by ALL columns of ANY type</strong>. (columns that are added by other plugins are not supported)

= Third party plugin support =

It will work nice with other plugins and support their additional custom columns. A few examples of plugins that are supported: WordPress SEO by Yoast (Robots Meta), Post Admin Shortcuts (Pin), WP Show IDs (ID) and User Access Manager (Access), WooCommerce, Co-Authors Plus and Advanced Custom Fields.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there documentation for Admin Columns? =

Yes, you will find all the documentation you need on <a href="http://www.admincolumns.com/documentation">http://www.admincolumns.com/documentation</a>.

= I have an idea for a great way to improve this plugin =

Great! I'd love to hear from you.
Leave your feedback at http://www.admincolumns.com/support.

= How can I change the thumbnail size of images? =

You can select a custom size for your custom field option from the Column options.

**my columns thumbnails still have the wrong size**

If you want your already uploaded images to display the newly added size you will need to regenerate the thumbnail for them. Use this plugin to generate the newly added sized thumbnails: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/.

= How can I enable the use of Hidden Custom Fields? =

Go to settings tab and select the option to "show hidden custom fields".
This will enable you to select your HIDDEN custom fields in de dropdown menu under "Custom Field:".

= How can I display a custom value in the Custom Fields Column? =

With this filter 'cac/column/meta/value' you can control what the value will be for any Custom Field Column.

Filter explained:

* **$value** is the original value which would otherwise be displayed
* **$id** will return the ID of the object.
* **$column** will return the Admin Columns Column object.
*
* **$column->options->field** is the name of your custom field
* **$column->storage_model->key** will return either the posttype or if it is any other type it will return wp-comments, wp-links, wp-users, wp-media.

For example if you have a custom posttype 'demo' with a custom_field that is called 'city' and the result would be an integer '33'. You can change that integer '33' to Amsterdam.

`
<?php
function my_custom_field_value( $value, $id, $column ) {

	$post_type  	= 'demo';
	$custom_field 	= 'city';

	// make sure we have the correct posttype and custom field
	if ( $post_type == $column->storage_model->key && $custom_field == $column->options->field ) {

		if ( '33' == $value )
			$value = 'Amsterdam';

		elseif ( '34' == $value )
			$value = 'New York';
	}
	return $value;
}
add_filter( 'cac/column/meta/value', 'my_custom_field_value', 10, 3 );
?>
`
