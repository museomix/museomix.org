Remove and delete old revision of posts, pages and related meta content completely then optimize Database: reduce size and optimization to speed up!

== Description == 

Better Delete Revision not only deletes redundant revisions of posts from your Wordpress Database, it also deletes other database content related to each revision such meta information, tags, relationships, and more.
Better Delete Revision is based on the old "Delete Revision" plugin but it is compatible with the latest version of Wordpress (3.x) with improved features.
= Your current published, scheduled, and draft posts are never touched by this plugin! =
This plugin can also perform optimizations on your Wordpress database. With optimization and old revision removal this plugin will keep your database lighter and smaller throughout use. Removing old revisions and database optimizations is one of the best things you can do to your Wordpress blog to keep it running as fast as it can.

Please pay ATTENTION, even if we added a fix that solve the problem, if you use the NextGEN Gallery plugin, some problems may occur when deleting revisions of posts or pages that contain the shortcode of the NextGEN Gallery plugin. So if you also use the NextGEN Gallery plugin we recommend you to make a backup before using the Better Delete Revision.

Wordpress MU or customs installation (like some pre-made installation of some Hosting Providers) are not yet supported. Wordpress MU support is in our TODO list.

Post Revisions are a feature introduced in Wordpress 2.6. Whenever you or Wordpress saves a post or a page, it automatically creates a revision and stores in your Wordpress database. Each additional revision will slowly increase the size of your database. If you save a post or page multiple times, your number of revisions will greatly increase overtime. For example, if you have 100 posts and each post has 10 revisions you could be storing up to 1,000 copies of older data! The Better Delete Revision plugin is your #1 choice to quickly and easily removing revision from your Wordpress database. Try it out today to see what a lighter and smaller Wordpress database can do for you!
